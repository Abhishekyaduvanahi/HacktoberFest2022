# Hacktoberfest Contributor Guide ðŸŽƒ

Hacktoberfest 2022 is finally here, and we're pretty excited about it. Open source developers also play a crucial role in making API's accessible and compatible with different ecosystems.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) is an annual festival hosted by DigitalOcean that takes place in the month of October to celebrate the open source community. As part of this 31-day celebration, contributors and open source maintainers are encouraged to work on open source projects and win swag to mark the occasion.

## Tips for contributors
- PRs beyond our open issues are welcome but make sure your contributions are meaningful and beneficial to other users otherwise your PR may be closed and marked as â€˜invalidâ€™.
- Issues before PRs. If you plan to make a contribution, please make sure there is an issue for it. You can either find an existing issue or open a new issue if none exists.
- PRs fulfill all the required conditions will be labeled as "hacktoberfest-accepted" before merging.


## Ready to make a contribution? 
If youâ€™re working on an open issue, read the CONTRIBUTING.MD file in the repo to get specific guidelines on how to work on that repo. Ask to be assigned to that issue before you start working on it.

If youâ€™re building a demo app, writing a tutorial or blog post, fork the README.MD file in the erx21/HacktoberFest2022 repo and make PR with a link to what youâ€™ve worked on and an email address we can reach out to you to claim your swag on.

You will receive a review, comment, and approval by a member of the Pusher team within a couple of days. All PRs accepted by the team will be marked as â€˜hacktoberfest-acceptedâ€™ by October 31st.
